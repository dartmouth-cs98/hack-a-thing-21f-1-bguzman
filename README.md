# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 
I attempted to build a small on swift called Landmarks that allows its users to favorite their preferred locations and had basic functions such as scrolling and nice windows.

## Who Did What?
Individual Project 

## What you learned
The first tutorial taught me how to use the basic views system of Swift and how they can incoporated horizontally, vertically, and on top of each other.
I could follow along for the most part and really appreciated the quiz at the end. Swift seems to be a very specific language so there's a lot of syntax to learn. 

The second tutorial showed how to create a scrolling list and how to fine-tune the previews for different sizes.
