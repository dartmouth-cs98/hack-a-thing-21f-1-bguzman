# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 
I attempted to build a small app on Xcode using Swift called Landmarks that allows its users to favorite their preferred locations and had basic functions such as scrolling and some buttons that provided details on each location's hike.

## Who Did What?
Individual Project 

## What you learned
The first tutorial taught me how to use the basic views system of Swift and how they can incoporated horizontally, vertically, and on top of each other.
I could follow along for the most part and really appreciated the quiz at the end. Swift seems to be a very specific language so there's a lot of syntax to learn. 

The second tutorial showed how to create a scrolling list and how to fine-tune the previews for different sizes, this was a bit more complicated to follow.
The third one covered adding a star button to favorite locations and then configure the display to only list favorited locations.
The fourth and fifth tutorials covered how to creat a small badge with built in swift graphics and how to animate a transition. 


Overall this project was fun but got increasingly hard to follow as the explanations weren't the most in-depth and I feel like I have a very superficial understanding of the structure of Swift. Quizzes at the end of each tutorial did help but I was still left with many questions as to the specific details on a lot of code.

I think the interface with the canvas is very helpful as it lets you see live what you're typing and how it affects the view. The numerous files make it a bit hard to follow what you're working on and having to update all the other files at the same time.
